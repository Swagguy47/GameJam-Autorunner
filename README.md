# GameJam-Autorunner
A small autorunner project I created as a part of a two week gamejam for a class. Automatically generated levels, random abilities and stat upgrades, 4 gamemodes, tutorial, etc.

I don't really have plans to expand this further, its a quick little time waster game, so maybe a mobile port, but other than that I'm pretty satisfied with how it is.

You may make modifications and look around and stuff, use scripts as a base, whatever. Just don't make any full product out of it without credit, and I'd prefer you keep branches non commercial, though I can make exceptions if needed. Thanks.
